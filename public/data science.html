            <h3>What is Data Science?</h3>
            <p>Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization‚Äôs data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.</p>
            <p>The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science one of the fastest-growing fields across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the ‚Äúsexiest job of the 21st century‚Äù by Harvard Business Review. Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.</p>
            <h3>The Data Science Lifecycle</h3>
            <p><strong>Data ingestion:</strong> The lifecycle begins with the data collection‚Äîboth raw structured and unstructured data from all relevant sources using a variety of methods. These methods can include manual entry, web scraping, and real-time streaming data from systems and devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Data storage and data processing:</strong> Since data can have different formats and structures, companies need to consider different storage systems based on the type of data that needs to be captured. Data management teams help to set standards around data storage and structure, which facilitate workflows around analytics, machine learning, and deep learning models.</p>
            <p><strong>Data analysis:</strong> Here, data scientists conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns, ranges, and distributions of values within the data. This exploration drives hypothesis generation for a/b testing and helps analysts determine the data‚Äôs relevance for modeling efforts.</p>
            <p><strong>Communicate:</strong> Finally, insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations that make the insights‚Äîand their impact on business‚Äîeasier for business analysts and other decision-makers to understand. A data science programming language such as R or Python includes components for generating visualizations; alternately, data scientists can use dedicated visualization tools.</p>
